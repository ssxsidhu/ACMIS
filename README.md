## Major Features
Users are able to search for flights by the takeoff and destination location. They are then able to book from those flights returned from the search. This feature is available in the "Book Flights" tab at the bottom of the screen.

Users can also go to the manage flight screen by pressing the "Manage Flights" tab at the bottom. Here, users can look at the details of all of their upcoming flights. The flights here are sorted by their takeoff date and time.
