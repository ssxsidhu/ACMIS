-> ACMIS is an Java - android application. It focuses on 2 major target groups which include: Airlines and Clients.
-> The Airline user is able to create an account for business. It can add, delete and make changes to flights. 
   Considering the budjet, it can also own airplanes and add flights accordingly.
-> The Clients are customers who want to book a flight from one place to another. 
   They will also be able to create an account and use it to book, cancel or even re-schedule flights.

** The project is divided into 4 iterations.
